I have successfully initialized the frontend architecture.
1.  **Dependencies**: Installed `antd`, `react-router-dom`, `@tanstack/react-query`, and `axios`.
2.  **Structure**: Established the core directory structure (`app`, `features`, `pages`, `shared`) and configured path aliases (`@/`).
3.  **Routing & Layouts**: Implemented `AppRouter` with `MainLayout` and `AuthLayout`, and integrated `AppProviders` for global context.
4.  **Verification**: Successfully built the project (`npm run build`), confirming the setup is correct and error-free.
